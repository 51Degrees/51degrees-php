# Every 51Degrees environment variable name in this repository starts with an
# underscore, because a POSIX shell cannot set a name that starts with a digit,

# every file git tracks, which leaves out build output and the submodules, and
# fails on any name that starts with the digit and on any fallback name.

# Dot-sourcing the script defines Find-EnvironmentNameProblem without reading
# the repository, which is how its tests use it.

# cloud service takes and the cloud_endpoint pipeline setting, so those three
# are matched only where the line reads or sets a variable, or names one in a
